    **Welcome to the Stock Analysis & Portfolio Optimization Dashboard!**

    This application is designed to empower you with data-driven insights for making more informed investment decisions. Whether you want to dissect a single stock or build and test a diversified portfolio, you'll find the tools you need here.

    ---

    ### **What can you do? :)**

    *   **ðŸ“ˆ Stock Analysis Page:**
        *   Dive deep into an individual stock by entering its ticker symbol.
        *   Get a comprehensive suite of metrics:
            *   Technical indicators and signals.
            *   Fundamental data and valuation ratios.
            *   Risk analysis relative to a benchmark (like `SPY`).
            *   Time series forecasting (ARIMA/GARCH).
            *   Monte Carlo simulations for future price projections.
            *   Analyst sentiment summary.
        *   Receive a data-driven **investment recommendation** (Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Reduce, Sell) based on a weighted score across all analyses.

    *   **ðŸ“Š Portfolio Analysis Page:**
        *   Manage your custom list of stocks (your watchlist or current holdings).
        *   Calculate the **optimal portfolio allocation** based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to maximize the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).
        *   Perform **backtesting** on the optimized portfolio to see how the strategy would have performed historically against a benchmark.

    ### **Getting Started**

    1.  **(Optional) Configure Global Settings:** Adjust the *Risk-Free Rate* and *Benchmark Ticker* below if needed. These settings influence calculations like the Sharpe Ratio and risk metrics.
    2.  **Navigate using the sidebar:**
        *   Select **ðŸ“ˆ Stock Analysis** to analyze a single ticker. Use its sidebar to enter the ticker and run the analysis.
        *   Select **ðŸ“Š Portfolio Analysis** to manage your list, optimize, and backtest. Use its sidebar to modify the ticker list and run the optimization/backtesting.

    Set the core assumptions used for calculations throughout the analysis tools. These settings apply globally.

    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** Represents the theoretical return of an investment with zero risk (often proxied by government T-bills). It's crucial for calculating risk-adjusted returns.
    *   **Benchmark Ticker:** The index or ETF you want to compare performance against (e.g., the overall market or a specific sector). Used to calculate Beta, Alpha, and for backtesting comparisons.

    Defaults are provided, but adjust them based on your assumptions or current market conditions if needed.
